        莊培鑫的創作，不斷地在數位與類比材質的轉換裡，思考在網路中龐大的且碎片化的影像與資訊，如何經由不同的創作手法，將這些記號轉化為可被經驗的對象，以構築出介於現實與虛構間，且帶有浪漫情懷的觀看影像方式。
        藝術家以1.98美金在圖庫網站買下這張中年白人男子的照片，並為照片裡的男子取名為David，將其交付給製作音樂的淘寶網路商場，以圖庫中描述照片的幾組關鍵字，如有吸引力、閃耀、英俊、愉快、陽光…等作為描述他的特質，譜出一首專屬於David的主題曲，而製作出以此虛構人物為題的《David》系列作品。同時展出的訊息雕塑，亦呈現藝術家對於影像的另一面思考，在扭曲、凹折的雕塑表面所堆砌的圖像中，呈現影像在網路中成為可被操作與捏塑的物質形式。

        The practices of CHUANG Pei-Xin constantly ponder over how the massive
        and fragmented images and information on the Internet turn these signs
        into objects that can be experienced through different creative
        approaches in the conversion of digital and analogue materials so as to
        construct a romantic image viewing method situated between reality and
        fictionality. The artist bought the photograph of a middle-aged
        Caucasian male from an image database website at the cost of 1.98 USD.
        Then, he named the male in the photograph David before commissioning it
        to a Taobao online shop for music production. With the several keywords
        assigned by the image database to the photograph as his traits, such as
        attractive, radiant, handsome, joyful, sunshine, etc., a theme song was
        composed specifically for David. The song gives birth to the work series
        themed with this fictional figure, David. Meanwhile, the information
        sculptures exhibited present the artist’s another thought regarding
        images as well. Through the stacked images on the twisted, concave
        surfaces of sculptures, he demonstrates that images become a material
        form that can be operated and molded on the Internet.
