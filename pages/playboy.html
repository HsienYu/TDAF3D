        《美西去了哪裡？》是一部11集的錄像作品，最初發佈在社交媒體「Tik
        Tok」上。通過對主角「美西」在疫情中的境遇，其被隔離的生活、死而復生以及尋找祖父農莊的報導，作品討論了疫情之下舊有社群結構的瓦解，去集體化後以新共同體的產生，以及有關遠端居家共同體、口罩政策、疫情下的社會公平等問題。
        作品運用3D建模和VR雕塑工具製作，藉由科幻奇想，給出了一系列疫情時代的生活提案，讓觀者連結並思考當前人類的處境。武子楊的作品沒有提出解答或爭論，而是向觀眾提出了當前情況如何發展以及觀眾應如何應對的一系列問題

        Where Did Macy Go? is an 11-episode animated video told through a series
        of reports of Macy’s encounter with the epidemic, life during the
        quarantine, search for his grandfather’s farm, and his revival.
        Published initially on “Tik Tok”, the video discusses the collapse of
        old community structures, the emergence of a new community after
        de-collectivization, and the new tele-republic of home, “mask politics”
        and social justice under the pandemic. With 3D Modeling, VR Sculpting
        technique, and the unique sci-fi perspective, the work presents several
        possibilities for life in the pandemic era that calls for the readers’
        reflection into their own lives and society. Instead of providing an
        evident answer or debate, Ziyang Wu challenges the audience with a
        series of questions about the relationship between modern society,
        development, and humanity’s responses in the future world.
