        在3DCG
        動畫筆下，城市空間中存在的各種工業產物和巨大的人造物體，與原有的符號脫鉤、獨立，描繪出一種新的風景樣態。
        自環繞郊區的童年原貌提取城市的功能性，揉合成景色，描繪著某處、某種特定視角，一種被填滿的場景感受。收集來的庭園石塊朝著各自所適之處行進著。
        沙漠中存在著綠洲城市A和B。A和B在物理上相距遙遠，但若達成某些條件，將會生成名為C的新土壤，且不受地圖和時間的連續性影響。在C之中，都市A的電線桿和都市B的電線桿彼此相鄰，時不時的接起又斷掉，如此反覆。播放中的CG圖像有可能就是C的土壤。

        Based on the original landscape of my childhood, mainly in the suburbs,
        I extracted the functions of the city and fused them into this
        "unaccounted landscape". A place that brings fulfillment, felt from a
        particular place and perspective. Behind the fence, garden stones are
        gathered, collected, and shipped to their respective locations. Two
        forces (two types of electric lights) are engaged in an ongoing exchange
        for a unit of water, an important concept in this land. Rocks clad in
        highway radio signs as textures communicate with each other. Let's say
        there are two oasis cities A and B in the desert. A and B are physically
        very far away from each other, but when certain conditions are met, a
        new soil called C, which is free from the continuum of maps and time, is
        created. In C, the utility poles in A and B are next to each other,
        repeatedly connecting and dissolving. In C, the utility poles in A and B
        are next to each other, connecting and dissolving repeatedly, and the CG
        image being shown may represent the soil of C. The CG image and the CG
        space looking into it from another layer are created. Each
        Three-dimensional sculptures looks like an object that appears in a 3DCG
        image, but when installed in reality, they have a different texture and
        weight and color, and are completely different entities.
