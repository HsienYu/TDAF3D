        作品《入侵事件》源自《魔獸世界》中國網民 (玩家) 入侵臺灣伺服器事件
        (2007~2011)
        以中國難民入侵臺灣伺服器事件作為文本出發，影像內容以代表中國審查的角色模型作為符號，使用遊戲引擎與模擬群集運動算法創造大量聚合的角色模型無意識抽動的具有衝擊性、湧入感的人流，以及試圖思考何謂數位廢墟、網路空間的廢棄區域、無人的伺服器狀態。事件起因於中國伺服器代理權爭議與中國對遊戲的審查問題，造成了大量中國玩家以公會為單位遷移到語言相近且版本正常更新的台灣的伺服器，造成台版伺服器的延遲與排隊等登入的慘況，台灣伺服器的遊戲體驗變得極差，有中國帶來的打金工作室、吵雜且充滿簡體字的對話頻道和中國玩家的政治爭執。不同地區的玩家在同個空間，遊戲中進行互動與現實發生連結，遊戲內發生的事件也能與台灣面對中國的威脅、交流等近況和兩方之間的誤解和衝突等等進行對話。

        Invasion is based on the 2007~2011 Chinese World of Warcraft (WoW)
        netizens (players) invasion, starting with Chinese players taking refuge
        in Taiwanese servers. Using character models that symbolize China’s
        censorship, the game engine and simulation cluster motion algorithm
        create a large number of aggregated character models that unconsciously
        twitch, representing the influx of people into digital servers,
        attempting to raise discussion regarding what is meant by digital ruins,
        abandoned areas of cyberspace, and unmanned servers. The incident
        stemmed from a dispute over Chinese server agency rights and Chinese
        censorship of elements in the game, resulting in a large number of
        Chinese players to migrate to the Taiwanese server with similar language
        settings and consistent updates, which in turn caused delays and players
        queueing to log into Taiwanese servers. The game play experience in
        Taiwanese servers took a quick plummet: “Chinese gold farming studios”
        also entered the server, public channels became full of noisy dialogues
        in simplified characters, and political disputes took place between
        Chinese and Taiwanese players. When players from different regions game
        in the same cyberspace, their interactions within the game space can be
        reflected in reality. Players can also engage in dialogue in the game
        regarding China’s threats toward Taiwan, recent exchanges, and
        misunderstandings and conflicts between the two parties.
